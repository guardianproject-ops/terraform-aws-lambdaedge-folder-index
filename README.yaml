# Short description of this project
description: |-

  This is a terraform module that deploys a lambda@edge that rewrites
  origin-requests and routes them to different origins depending on the domain
  specified in the path.

  For example if the lambda is configured with an origin domains list of
  foobar.com and www.example.org, then requests the following requests would be
  rewritten

  * `/foobar.com/hello/there` -> `/hello/there` (routed to foobar.com origin)
  * `/www.example.org/site/feed.xml` -> `/site/feed.xml` (routed to www.example.org origin)
  * `/somethingelse.com/page` -> 400 invalid origin returned
